Run the app:

streamlit run app.py

Libraries Used
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Sklearn

Model
The model used in this project is XGBRegressor.
XGBRegressor is a gradient boosting tree model that is used for regression tasks. It works by building an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree is trained to correct the errors made by the previous trees. This process is repeated until a satisfactory level of accuracy is reached on the training data.

Accuracy
The model has an accuracy of 99%.
